# Diamond Selection Order

This is a selection problem solved using recursion.

## The Problem

There are *n* diamonds of different values in a queue. It is possible that *2* or more diamonds can have the same price. You are competing against an opponent and your goal is to maximize your winnings. Design an algorithm that returns which diamonds you should choose in order to achieve your goal.

### The Rules

Both you and the opponent can take a diamond either from the start or the end of the queue. You play first.

#### Key Assumption

The opponent **always** chooses the most valuable diamond.
